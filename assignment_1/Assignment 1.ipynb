    "**Describe what happens to the network when p=1.**\n",
    "    - One of the characteristic of a random network model is that it contains low average path lenght, meaning that there tends to be a path between a pair of nodes that involves only a few edges. This is called the small world problem and the average distance in such a network can be described by the following formula <d> = ln(N)/ln(k), where k is the average degree of the network and N is the number of nodes in the network. In a Watts storgatz p stands for the probability that an edge is rewired, meaning that the edge is disconnected from one of its nodes and randomly connected to another node anywhere in the network. Each edge is chosen to be rewired independent with probability p. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    So when the probability is low then most connections are still in the original form, therefore they connect to the original local connections, they connect nodes that are nearby in the lattice. But some of the rewired edges might turn into long distance connections that connects nodes that are far away from each other, therefore lowering the average path length. These paths are called shortcuts and they lower the overall average path lenght of the network, so when P increases more and more rewiring happens. When P = 1 then all of the edges are rewired and we end up with a random network. Like we have mentioned earlier one of the characteristic of randum network is that the average path length can be described with this formula <d> = ln(N)/ln<k>. Calculating this for our network of N = 500 and k = 4 gives the average distance of 4.483. Like you can see here above the average shortest path decreases with increasing p and when p = 1 then the average distance is quite close to the theoretical value for a random network.\n",
